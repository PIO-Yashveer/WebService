Creating a Web Server on IBMi.
First we need to create a http server.
We can use IBMi Navigator to create a new http server.
Create a new http server.
Provide configuration for the server.
Once the server is created, edit the configuration file.
The Server.conf file in this folder is used for http server configuration.
Now Start the Server (Restart if already running).
Now the Server is Created.
